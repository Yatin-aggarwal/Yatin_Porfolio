       title:"Pixel Prompt",
       content:"Pixel Prompt is a Generative AI project where anime character images are generated based on user-provided prompts. It follows a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) approach for image generation. For prompt generation, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to encode the prompts, which are then concatenated with random noise and fed into the generator. The discriminator receives both the generator's output and the userâ€™s prompt encoding to distinguish between real and fake images. The project uses the Hugging Face dataset \"alfredplpl/anime-with-caption-cc0,\" which is approximately 21 GB in size and contains 15,000 images with corresponding prompts for supervised learning. Additionally, Pixel Prompt utilizes the \"openai-community/gpt2\" tokenizer from Hugging Face for handling textual inputs. ",

        title:'Color World',
        content:'Color World is a project that leverages neural networks to generate color images from grayscale inputs. It operates on the concept of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to colorize images. The model is trained on the large CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. By learning meaningful representations of the grayscale input, the VAE-based model reconstructs the image in color, adding realistic and context-aware hues to the grayscale image during the decoding process.
